avrcpp
======
This project aims to create a c++ wrapper for some AVR chipsets.

The core aim is to make a high quality and high performance library.

The emphasis is on being able to use the chips in the Arduino hardware without
needing to use the Arduino IDE. Unlike the Arduino project this project is not
really aimed at beginners.
